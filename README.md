# aCw-S-PullResourceAdditions
PullResourceAdditions items for use with Dedicated Storage (Plus Extinction core items) on aCw Servers

To include the additional vanilla items and items from the mod, open the gameusersettings.ini from the extinction core modded servers and paste the content from the PullResourceAdditions.txt behind PullResourceAdditions=

EXAMPLE:
PullResourceAdditions=/Game/PrimalEarth/CoreBlueprints/Resources/PrimalItemResource_Pelt.PrimalItemResource_Pelt,/Game/PrimalEarth/Test/PrimalItemConsumable_Egg_Ankylo.PrimalItemConsumable_Egg_Ankylo

It is a comma separated list! No wordwrap!

The especially for the aCw Extinction Core Servers edited list is as short as possible but very useful in terms of the server settings. As a general rule i have deleted all the stuff we usually don't collect and maintain all the valuable stuff we often use. For example i have deleted Extinction Core dyes, some ammo/explosives, soups, traps, stackable weapons, seeds, eggs and kibbles. On the other hand i have included for example trophies, alpha trophies and some usefull ammo.
